## Chapter 1: The Beginning

narrator: It was a quiet morning when Alice first noticed something unusual about the old bookshop on the corner. The door, which had been locked for as long as anyone could remember, stood slightly ajar.

alice: That's strange. I've walked past this place every day for years, and I've never seen it open.

narrator: She pushed the door gently. It swung inward with a soft creak, revealing rows upon rows of dusty shelves stretching back into shadows.

alice: Hello? Is anyone here?

narrator: No answer came. But as she stepped inside, a voice rang out from somewhere deep within the stacks.

bob: Ah, a visitor! I've been expecting you. Well, not you specifically. But someone. It's been quite a long time.

alice: Who are you? How long have you been in here?

bob: Longer than you'd believe. But that's a story for another chapter.

## Chapter 2: The Discovery

narrator: Alice followed the voice deeper into the shop. The shelves grew taller, and the books grew older. Some had titles in languages she didn't recognize.

bob: Every book in here contains a story that someone needed to tell. Some are histories. Some are futures. And a few, well, a few are doors.

alice: Doors? What do you mean, doors?

bob: Open one and find out.

narrator: Alice reached for a small leather-bound volume on the nearest shelf. The moment her fingers touched the spine, the room began to shimmer.
