speaker: Hello and welcome. This is a demonstration of AI-powered text-to-speech generation using voice cloning technology.

speaker: You can write as many paragraphs as you need. Each line starting with the speaker name followed by a colon will be generated as a separate audio segment.

speaker: The segments are then automatically combined into a single audio file with natural spacing between them.

speaker: To use a different voice, create a voice profile first by providing a short audio sample of the desired voice, then use that profile name as the speaker name in your script.
